# Fixed-Priority Scheduling with Standby-Sparing under (m, k)-Deadlines – Partial Replication

This repository contains a Python implementation of a **fixed-priority scheduler** (Rate-Monotonic–like) for a **standby-sparing real-time system** with \((m, k)\)-firm deadlines.

The code is a **partial replication** of the algorithmic ideas from the following paper:

> Linwei Niu and Dakai Zhu,  
> *"Fixed-Priority Scheduling for Reliable and Energy-Aware (m,k)-Deadlines Enforcement with Standby-Sparing,"*  
> IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems (TCAD), 2021.
> (Implementation here focuses on the R-pattern selective approach, without full energy modeling.)
